ToolipsSVG.jl is yet another toolips extension, this one sporting SVG-oriented Components to serve as a base visualization library. This will be recycling the `Component` structure from Toolips and putting context to SVGs. This brings the possibility of just about anything to be programmed using session syntax and SVGs, programmed animations, even! More work will gradually come in on this, until then contributions are appreciated!
